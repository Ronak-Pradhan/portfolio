## Education			        		
- B.Tech, ECE | Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal (_September 2023_)

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ Optum (_January 2024 - Present_)**
- Initiated domain specialization/adaptation of LLMs for a task-specific business use case, i.e., to conduct sophisticated
 reasoning on complex healthcare documents using libraries like transformers and peft.
- Fine-tuned BioClinical BERT on high-quality data for textual entailment, improving precision significantly.
- Dockerized a Flask application for model serving and deployed the BioClinical BERT model on SageMaker with an
 asynchronous endpoint on AWS.

**Applied Scientist Intern @ Amazon (_February 2023 - July 2023_)**
- Developed and fine-tuned advanced machine learning models (like GANs and LLMs), driving a 0.4% increase in
 Precision at 1% Recall, a 0.2% boost in ROC AUC, and a 0.4% rise in Cold Start ROC AUC, enhancing the
 customer experience for product purchases on Amazon.in.
- Mastered rapid learning of state-of-the-art ML/AI research, enabling seamless integration into project workflows.
- Excelled in results-oriented analysis, extracting actionable insights from model outputs to drive enhancements.
- Managed and analyzed extensive datasets, ranging from millions to over 100 million data points (terabyte scale), using tools
 like PySpark and SQL, excelling in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and effective data handling techniques.
- Produced detailed project documentation, communicated impact to diverse stakeholders, and invited feedback from 10+
 experienced scientists, fostering iterative improvement and alignment with project goals.
